          <hr>
          <p>
‪How to stake out tents on a sandy beach – Scout Life magazine‬‏
you can just use stuff you find around the beach like pieces of driftwood, rocks, etc. to anchor your tent. For instance, find a smallish branch, tie your guy line to it, and then bury the branch below the sand so the line is taut. That should hold it well. Repeat for each of the lines of your tent.</p>
